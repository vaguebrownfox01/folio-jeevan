summary: 'Asthma and COPD are major health issues with underdiagnosis, leading to reduced quality of life and premature death. Spirometry is a gold standard test but its accuracy can be hindered by challenges. Pnoi-phone, an acoustic-based method, can help diagnose respiratory diseases accurately and effortlessly, especially in remote clinics, with key considerations of affordability, portability, and ease of use.'

# Pnoi-phone

Detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases using simultaneously recorded vocal breath sounds and pulmonary(chest) auscultation.

## Introduction

Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are major global health issues. Asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 4,61,000 deaths, while COPD caused 3.23 million deaths in the same year [1]. The underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases is a significant societal challenge, leading to chronic health problems, reduced quality of life, and even premature death [2].

Spirometry is a gold standard test used to diagnose respiratory diseases through medical history, physical examination, and breathing tests [3]. Although it can measures lung function accurately, challenges such as limited repeatability and the need for patient cooperation, and equipment calibration affect the test's accuracy; high cost, complexity, and limited availability of spirometric testing can hinder the accuracy diagnosis and treatment for respiratory diseases, particularly for those in underserved populations [4].

Pnoi-phone is an acoustic-based method to evaluate pulmonary function test values (PFT) for the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma, using the Pnoi-phone device to capture and analyze breath sounds from mouth and chest simultaneously. This allows for accurate and effortless diagnosis of respiratory diseases, especially in remote clinics, enabling early intervention and treatment. For successful scaling and introduction of the device into healthcare: affordability, portability, and ease of use are key considerations, along with simplified training for healthcare workers and infrastructure for data collection, storage, and analysis. Ensuring proper usage and optimal patient care would also require further research.
