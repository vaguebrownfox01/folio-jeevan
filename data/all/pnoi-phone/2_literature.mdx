## Literature

Auscultation is a non-invasive and cost-effective physical examination technique
that is optimal for prognosis, but interpreting the auditory information of lung
breath sounds requires years of experience and specialization <Ref>[1]</Ref>. Digital
stethoscopes can enhance, record, and store auscultation sounds for future
reference, providing a research path for exploring ways to automate diagnosing
and monitoring respiratory disease using the sound of breath <Ref>[2]</Ref>. Several
studies have investigated the use of breath sounds as a potential tool for
detecting and monitoring asthma <Ref>[3]</Ref><Ref>[4]</Ref><Ref>[5]</Ref>.

The studies included in the literature review utilized different methods of
recording breath sounds, including microphone recordings from the mouth and
trachea using handheld microphones, and pulmonary auscultation using a
stethoscope or contact microphone. The studies also varied in terms of their
sample sizes, with some studies including only a few patients while others
included several hundred. The majority of studies found that breath sounds
recorded from the pulmonary auscultation can provide useful information for
diagnosing and monitoring asthma. Comparatively less analysis have been done
using vocal breath sounds than lung breath sounds.
