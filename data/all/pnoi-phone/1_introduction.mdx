### An acoustic-based method for detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases using simultaneously recorded vocal breath sounds and pulmonary(chest) auscultation.

<br/>

## Introduction

Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are major global health
issues. Asthma affected an estimated <Ul>262 million</Ul> people in 2019 and caused <Ul>4,61,000 deaths</Ul>, while COPD caused 3.23 million deaths in the same year <Ref>[1]</Ref>. The
underdiagnosis of respiratory diseases is a significant societal challenge, leading to chronic health
problems, reduced quality of life, and even premature death <Ref>[2]</Ref>.

Spirometry is a gold standard test used to diagnose respiratory diseases through
medical history, physical examination, and breathing tests <Ref>[3]</Ref>.
Although it can measures lung function accurately, challenges such as limited
repeatability and the need for patient cooperation, and equipment calibration
affect the test's accuracy; <Ul>high cost, complexity, and limited availability</Ul> of
spirometric testing can hinder the accuracy diagnosis and treatment for
respiratory diseases, particularly for those in underserved populations <Ref>[4]</Ref>.

<Ul>Pnoi-phone is an acoustic-based method</Ul> to evaluate pulmonary function test values (PFT) for the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma, using the Pnoi-phone device to capture and analyze
breath sounds from mouth and chest simultaneously. This allows for accurate and effortless diagnosis
of respiratory diseases, especially in remote clinics, enabling early intervention and treatment. For
successful scaling and introduction of the device into healthcare: <Ul>affordability, portability, and ease of use</Ul> are key considerations, along with simplified training for healthcare workers and infrastructure
for data collection, storage, and analysis. Ensuring proper usage and optimal patient care would also
require further research.
