Jeevan K, a 2020 Electronics & Communication Engineering graduate from MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology with a broad range of interests; a few highlighted ones include programming, visual arts, graphic design and AI. Most of his time in SPIRE lab is used to explore signal-processing and machine-learning, its implementation in hardware and software to assist research and solve real-world problems. Listening to math-rock, drawing with black ink and reading non-fiction are some of his coping mechanisms. Oversampling his way through. Doesn't talk much :') 

PS: Everything is a signalâ€”in dire need of processing.
